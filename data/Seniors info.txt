Ayaan shaikh:I am a B.Tech Computer Science student with a CGPA of 9.4 and a strong academic foundation
in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development. I have hands-on
experience building MERN stack applications and integrating modern AI models into real-world
systems.
I have previously conducted a technical session on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Bot
Development, where I demonstrated how to build intelligent chatbots using vector databases,
embeddings, and LLM integration for context-aware responses.
Currently, I am involved in research focused on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, where I
work on applied AI problems and model-based experimentation.
As the Vice Chair of the ACM Student Chapter, I actively lead technical initiatives, mentor peers,
and organize knowledge-driven workshops. Through this Chatbot Creation Workshop, I aim to
simplify AI-powered chatbot development and guide students in building practical, scalable
conversational systems from scratch.
